\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.3}{\ignorespaces Extincted afterglow spectrum of GRB120815A in black. The broad absorption feature at 4100 \r A~ is from Lyman $\alpha $ absorption in the host indicating a redshift of $z \sim 2.35$. A multitude of narrow absorption lines are visible in the spectrum belonging to various ionic species of elements. The thick red line is the continuum level, as determined from the normalization algorithm developed, the narrow red lines are the 1, 2, 3 $\sigma $ lines indicating the uncertainty in the continuum placement. The continuum-level algorithm will be presented in a future paper. \relax }}{9}{figure.caption.8}
